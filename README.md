# Recursive functions written to strengthen understanding of recursion, done as a part of The Odin Project

These were a pretty serious challenge for me. The entire assignment truthfully took far longer than it would have had I just sat down and really intensely tried to understand the concepts at hand.
Recursion seems to be a pretty tough stumbling block for me at this point, and I want to look into it deeper to try and get a better grasp on it because of that.

The first two of the methods return *n* terms of the fibonacci sequence, both iteratively and recursively. The second uses a merge sort algorithm to arrange an array of integers from lowest to highest.
